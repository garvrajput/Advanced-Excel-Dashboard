Hello Everyone,

I have created an interactive sales dashboard for the Vrinda Store using MS EXCEL.

Project Objective:- Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, Vrinda can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023.

In this Excel project , process I went through:-
1) Data Cleaning- Process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, and duplicate value within a dataset.
2) Data Processing- Two columns 'Age Group' and 'Month' were added for deeper analysis of dataset.
3) Data Analysis- Analyze the data with the help of pivot tables.
4) Data Visualization- Visualize the data with the help of various Charts,Graphs and slicers.

 Insights:-
-> Women are more likely to buy compared to men(~65%)
-> Maharastra,Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are top 3 states (~35%)
-> Adult age group (30-49 years) is max contributing(~50%)
-> Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing(~80%)

Final Conclusion To Improve Vrinda Store Sales In 2023:-
Target women customers of age group (30-49 years) living in Maharastra, Karnataka and UP by showing ads/offers/coupans available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
